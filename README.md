# dealers_choice_react_redux_thunks

<!-- 
x name your database acme-react-redux
x build your backend with express, pg, sequelize
be creative
x build your front end with react, redux, react-redux, redux-thunk, axios and   whatever other libraries you might need
x make sure to seed your data models so that you can display data on the front-end
allow user to modify backend database via post, delete, and optionally put requests
feel free to use the faker library (version 5.1.0) to generate data (instead of using forms)
feel free to use the installation scripts below to help get you started as well as the webpack.config.js, server.js, src/index.js and index.html code
use this file structure to start out:
        server.js
        src/index.js
        index.html


working incrementally is key
building a full stack application might seem daunting at first, but if you think about composing small parts of the application incrementally (and making sure they work as you do), the task is made much easier.

build a simple Sequelize model and seed some data when the express application starts

build an express api GET route which can be used by the client to return data from your model
build out your front end slowly using redux, react-redux, redux-thunk. You can keep things in one file and separate things out as you get things working.
when you are able to show the back end data on the front end, then you should move on
add an api POST route on your server which will insert data (you can use faker to make things simpler and you can test this with curl)
add the ability to create data in your react application
add an api DELETE route on your server which can be used to delete data
add the ability to destroy data in your react application
deploy


BONUS add an api PUT route on your server which can be used to update data
BONUS add the ability to update data in your react application (for simplicity this might be a boolean property on your model)
BONUS as you get things working, you can refactor- or add functionality or even another model
BONUS you might decide you want to add some links for filtering data by using the hashchange event -->
